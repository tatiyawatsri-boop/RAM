            <h3 class="hobby_text_p_r" style="width: 40rem; margin-left: -25rem;" >I learned the Ancient Thai boxing dance when I was a second-year military student. It was part of a 10-day volunteer training program that concluded with a performance on the final day. At first, I felt quite nervous because I  had never done anything like it before. But once I started practicing with my friends, it became really enjoyable. The dance required physical memory, rhythm, and flexibility—it was both challenging and fun.

After completing the training, we performed the dance, and all our hard work paid off with an excellent performance. Later, I continued practicing the movements to improve my body’s flexibility. When I moved up to the third year, I volunteered to perform once again.</h3>

            <h2>Thai chess</h2>
            <h3 class="hobby_text_p_l" style="width: 40rem;">I started playing Thai chess when I was in the upper  of primary school. At first, I wasn’t good at it at all I could barely move the pieces correctly. But when I entered middle school, I got the chance to play again, and this time it was serious because I had to compete on behalf of my school.

In the beginning, I didn’t enjoy it much since I didn’t really understand how to play. However, as I began to build a stronger foundation and practiced more seriously, I started to like it. Thai chess, to me, is a sport where you compete more against yourself than your opponent.The more mistakes you make, the greater your chance of losing so staying focused is everything.

That’s what I love about it. It trains me to think systematically and to stay calm under pressure. If you let your emotions be  swayed by your opponent, you end up playing their game instead of your own. That balance between strategy and self-control is what makes Thai chess so fascinating to me.

            <h3 class="hobby_text_p_r" style="width: 40rem;">I started skateboarding when I was in high school, and from the very first time I tried it, I was hooked. I loved how there were so many different tricks to learn — each one with its own level of difficulty. It was a real challenge for me, and that’s exactly what made it so exciting.

Whenever I skated, I would pick a trick that seemed within reach and keep practicing it over and over until I finally landed it. The moment I succeeded, I felt incredibly proud of myself. Then, I’d move on to learning a new, even more challenging trick.

Skateboarding also introduced me to a whole new community of people who shared the same passion. Meeting others who loved it as much as I did opened up my world and made the experience even more enjoyable. It’s something that truly makes me happy.</h3>
